# epicgl
A "basic" OpenGL program made in C++.
(DEVELOPMENT CURRENTLY ABANDONED)

## Controls
Controls like rotation speed, "shading" or moving around are available when executing it on the terminal.

## Compiling
```g++ main.cpp -o EpicGL_Linux64 -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc -lGLEW -lGLU -lSOIL -lglut -lGL```

Remember to compile in amd64 and have GLEW, GLUT, SOIL and GL libraries.<br>
For more info on compiling, message me. Make an issue to do so, it's the fastest way for me.
